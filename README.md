## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with core competencies using Python for development.

## ðŸ”­ What I Do
Most of my programming time is spent developing packages/source distributions to build ML models, experimenting, and deploying these models to production.
Unfortunately, most of my cool projects are owned by my employers (past and present) but I'm putting a few solutions together to showcase here.

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning
I'm learning how to maximize Google Cloud's Vertex AI capabilities for MLOps.
I'm also learning Docker and Kubernetes.
